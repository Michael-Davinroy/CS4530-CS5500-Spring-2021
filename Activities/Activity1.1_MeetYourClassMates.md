# Activity 1.1: Meet Your Classmates

The goal of this activity is to have the students meet at least a few of each other

1. Break into groups of 4 (use Zoom random assignment to rooms)
2. __Instructions to students:__ Introduce yourself to the other students in your breakout room.  Try to learn something interesting about each of the other students in your room.  It's probably a good idea to share your email address in the chat so you can continue the conversation later.  At the end of the activity, I will call on students and ask each of them to introduce someone *else* from your group.
3. At the end of the exercise, call on a student and ask them to introduce someone else from their group, and say something interesting about them.  If they can't say anything, you can ask things like
    * "where do they come from?" 
    * "where did they go to undergraduate school" 
    * "do they have any hobbies"
4. Repeat for however long you like.

__Suggested Time Frame:__ 15 minutes in groups, 10 minutes for recap.

_Mitch says:_ My plan is to have a spreadsheet to keep track of student responses (+1 for satisfactory respose, -1 for no response).  At the end of the term, I'll consult this for the Classroom Participation Grade.  I'll also use a random number generator to choose who to call on.
