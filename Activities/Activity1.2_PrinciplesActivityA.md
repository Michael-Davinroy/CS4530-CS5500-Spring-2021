# Activity 1.2: Design Principles

The goal of this activity is to have the students recognize uses (or violations) of the Design Principles in their previous coding

This is a two-part activity

1. __Part 1 (Individual, 10 minutes):__  Take the next 10 minutes to review some of their previous coding projects. This could be a homework, a term project, or something done outside of class, so long as it's something you can share.  Find one or two examples in your code where either
    * you used one of the principles and it was helpful
    * you didn't use one of the principles and it would have helped if you'd used it.
Be prepared to share your code in the Zoom and tell the class
    * what the relevant principle was and
    * how it either helped or would have helped.

2. __Part 2 (Groups of 4, 15 minutes):__ Present what you've found with your group and discuss.  It's not necessary for all 4 of you to present; it's better to have a good discussion.

3. __Wrapup (Timeframe: Flexible)__: Call on random students and ask them to present to the class.

_Mitch says:_ My plan is to have a spreadsheet to keep track of student responses (+1 for satisfactory respose, -1 for no response).  At the end of the term, I'll consult this for the Classroom Participation Grade. I'll also use a random number generator to choose who to call on.
