# Activity 1.2: Design Principles

The goal of this activity is to have the students recognize uses (or violations) of the Design Principles in their previous coding

This is a two-part activity

1. __Part 1 (Individual, 10 minutes):__  Like Principles Activity A, but give them a set of good and bad examples (to be supplied later, I hope).  For each of the examples, decide whether it's good or bad, and why.   

    Alternative: give examples in pairs and decide which one is better and why.

2. __Part 2 (Groups of 4, 15 minutes):__ Present what you've found with your group and discuss.  It's not necessary for all 4 of you to present; it's better to have a good discussion.

3. __Wrapup (Timeframe: Flexible)__: Call on random students and ask them to present to the class.

_Mitch says:_ My plan is to have a spreadsheet to keep track of student responses (+1 for satisfactory respose, -1 for no response).  At the end of the term, I'll consult this for the Classroom Participation Grade. I'll also use a random number generator to choose who to call on.
